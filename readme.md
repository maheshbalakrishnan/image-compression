# Compression experiment

Step 1: Decompress a JPEG into raw RGB bytes
Step 2: Apply Run-length encoding to compress the bytes and store into a file format (.chomp)
Step 3: Create a renderer for compressed image format
Step 4: Introduce filter techniques during compression phase
Step 5: Look for streaming and other performance benefits
